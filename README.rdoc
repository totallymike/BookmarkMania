=== BookmarkMania

This project depends on Ruby 2.0.0 and Rails 4.0.

Setting it up is fairly simple:

    git clone https://github.com/totallymike/BookmarkMania.git
    cd BookmarkMania
    bundle install
    rake db:migrate

Testing is performed with rspec  
  
    rspec


At the moment deployment is handled largely via Heroku.  There is a config file for Unicorn,
and Heroku handles the database configuration.
